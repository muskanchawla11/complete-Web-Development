1-start with creating two folder 
	frontend,backend
2-run npm init -y
3-node package->script->helps you to run , start ,build your app
4-npm install express mongoose dotenv
using express -> as web framework
moongose->interact with db
dotenv: access dotenv environment variables.
5-backend->server.js-.import express but to use this 
6-VERY IMPORTANT: go to node package and add "type":module
7-How to run your node app?
    1-in your terminal write node back (and press tab it will autocomplete), ser(tab, it will be autocompleted)
    2-or in your nodepackage -> script ->"dev":"node backend/server"
    now you can run your app as npm run dev
8-now whenever you will make any changes in your server it wont reflect until you refresh
so for that download npm i nodemon -D

9-connecting with db:
    1-go to mongodb->login->create new project->next->next->driver->you will get a password make sure you copy it somewhere->on next page you will get connection string copy it as well
    2-now create .env and paste 
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://muskanchawla115_db_user:<5WthWzUJRYll9ifV>@cluster0.crag4la.mongodb.net/Products?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
    you have to add password that you copied earlier
    YOU HAVE TO GIVE A NAME TO YOUR DATABASE : BEFORE ? WRITE DB NAME
    NEXT STEP IS GO TO NETWORK ACCESS-> you will see your ip address(it might change so it wont help you to connect to your db)-> go to add ip address->allow access from anywhere and its done

10-you want to print your env url?
    console.log(process.env.MONGO_URI)
    it will give undefined
    so you need to import import dotenv from "dotenv"; to make it work

11-next step: create a folder(config) in that create a file (db.js)
    in this file we are creating connection with moongose
    in your server.js file -> call connectDB() function to establish connection but make sure you import {connectDb}

IMPORTANT NOTE AND MISTAKES:
1-in your mongo_url you dont have to wrap your password inside <>
2-when you are exporting file , file in which you are importing it use import filename from
3-but when you are using named export then you have to use import {variable name} from filename

Tables vs collections
mysql,sqp->data in form of Tables
no-sql:collections which can have multiple data

12-create product.model.js: create schema

13-API->APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE

14- you have app written 5 times you want to modify all of them together , you can click on ctrl d, if you have 4 times app written you have to click ctrl d 4 times

15-Now what you did is : earlier you were having a single file server.js where you were putting router now you have created a seperate file to put all your routers
changes that you have made and why?
    1-creating a instance of router : express.Router()
    2-instead of app.get you will be using router.get
    3-in your server.js file you will be having a single line : app.use("api/product",productRoutes)
    which has the prefix that all route will have and the file name
    4-so now if your route is /api/product you dont have to write this, you can write "/" as prefix was mentioned in app.use

IMPORTANT : WHY MOONGOSE ? TO COMMUNICATE WITH DATABASE
