->starting with frontend
->as we want different pages
so we will be installing npm i react-router-dom

you are gonna be having nav bar for all routes as it is above routes
we are using a react icon to use it we have to write : npm i react-icons

Now the issue you : you have to pass props to each and every child 
but lets say your last child needs parent props
so it will cause prop drilling

we will be using zustand
1-install it 
npm i zustand





your frontend us running on 5173 and backend on 5000
so when you will deploy them you have to deploy both on two different servers
so can we do something in which we can bring them to a single domain?

step 1 : import path fron "path"
this helps to combine file paths correctly
step2:const _dirname=path.resolve
in react when we use import instead require _dirname is not automatically available
step3:below the routes check the environment
if(process.env.NODE_ENV==="production")

we want out frontend folder to be our static assests
so when you run your react app , you run as npm run build
it creates a dist folder


this folder we will be using in production for  react application that we have
now we have to make dist as out static asset folder
if(process.env.NODE_ENV==="production"){
    app.use(express.static(path.join(_dirname,"/frontend/frontend/dist")))

}

any other file then render react


once you have delete the nodemodule in your main pacakge json
under script 
"build":"npm install && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend
you are asking to install nodemodule for both frontend and backend and then building your react app

run npm run build to get node module and to build your app
"start":"node backend/server.js
used node instead of nodemon as its gonna be just running once


one last and important step is NODE_ENV is not set to production
"scripts": {
    "dev": "NODE_ENV=development nodemon backend/server.js",
    "build": "npm install && npm install --prefix frontend/frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend/frontend",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node backend/server.js"

  },


  npm install cross-env --save-dev

how to not add .env
bring your git ingnode file in root folder
put .env in it
